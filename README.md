# NewsBiasApp

An application that aggregates news articles and shows if the articles are biased or not<br />
We use a custom model built on tensorflow that uses BERT model as modules to identify the bias<br />
The dataset the model is trained on is a custom dataset that was formed by assigning different news outlets specific biases after studying them. (Yes it might involve our own biases, but we try to avoid this by cross verifying the biases with multiple websites online)<br />
We use JavaScript for the UI and Flask for the backend.<br />
